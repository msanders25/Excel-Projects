# Excel-Projects

## Overview
This repository contains several projects I have completed in Excel that highlight my proficiency in the software. The projects included here cover tasks such as data analysis and visualization to financial modeling and tax credit calculation. Within each project, I have included summary tabs with extended descriptions on what the project objective was, challenges and solutions, methods used, and actionable insights uncovered. See below.

### Sales Performance Analysis
This project contains the analysis for the sales perfomance of the Adidas brand using fictional sales data. The excel file displays visualizations reporting on several KPIs for company sales during 2020 and 2021. The data set used was pulled from a YT video and repurposed for building a sales performance dashboard to report on sales.

### ERC Credit Calculation
