## Overview
This repository contains several projects I have completed in Excel that highlight my proficiency in the software. The projects included here cover tasks such as data analysis and visualization to financial modeling and tax credit calculation. Within each project, I have included summary tabs with extended descriptions on what the project objective was, challenges and solutions, methods used, and actionable insights uncovered. See below.
